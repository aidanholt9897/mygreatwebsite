 <p> In order to Hack a Social Media account, you need to execute something commonly called a "SpearPhish" attack. A SpearPhish attack is where you pretend to
be someone or somethign else, to get a password. In Kali Linux there are programs that code them in PHP for you. A simple google search for "How to SpearPhish With Kali Linux" will do the trick.
What these attackers do is, for example, they send you an email or some sort of message that tells you to reset password, or something similiar, that would require you to enter your passwords or username into the syntax.
Also, it does not have to do with passwords. Such as, an attacker designs and Email saying that a certain batch of HP Laptops were manufactured with faulty batteries. 
Then they would link you to a Page that has a download to a PDF file, that tells you how to diagnose your Computer. When you Download the PDF file, it silently installs a encrypted RAT or Remote Administrator Tool, 
and since it is encrypted, Anti-Virus would not detect it. <a href="encrypt.html"> Click here to learn more about encrpytion. </a> Then the Person who downloaded the PDF would become the Slave, and the attacker could acess almost anything, including Credit Card Information, webcams, Microphone, a Keylogger, which is something that records what you type, and almost anything. 
The attacker could even control the computer or destroy it. Mostly, it is used for a Google Adsense Loop, which is when the Attacker has tons of slave computers on their Network, and the attacker could code a Python instruction, for all of the computers to click on their Ads, and per computer veiw, Google gives you money.
Then the attacker, could run a Virtual Machine, which is a computer inside of a computer, like a Simulation of a Computer, could also exponentially grow the amount of Computers on their Network, making more and more money. </p>
