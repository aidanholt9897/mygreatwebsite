 <p style="font-size:24px; color: #00ff00; text-align: center;">This webiste was made to help people who know nothing about hacking,
 to becoming experts. 
 I once Found Myself googling terms, and could not locate a central place where all the information was stored. 
 Here, is how things work, and how to do them. 
 To keep this clear, if you want to be a Expert at hacking or cracking, you must know how to code. 
 In order to destroy something, you must first first understand how it is build. Up above is a navigation bar to help you
 find your way through this website.
 Also, you will need Something called Kali Linux, which is a great way for beginners. It contains alot of tools for hacking.
 If you go to the <a style="color:white;" href="downloads".html">Downloads Tab</a> the download and a link to a video on how to install
 will be there! Also, text in <span style="color:lightblue;">Light Blue</span> will be text on separate info pages, Text in <span style="color:red ;">Red</span>
 will be a page acessible via the Navigation bar.</p>
