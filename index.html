 <p style="font-size:24px; color: #00ff00; text-align: center;"> Hi Guys, This webiste was made to help people who know nothing about hacking,
 to becoming experts. 
 I once Found Myself googling terms, and could not locate a central place where all the information was stored. 
 Here, is how things work, and how to do them. 
 To keep this clear, if you want to be a Expert at hacking or cracking, you must know how to code. 
 In order to destroy something, you must first first understand how it is build. Up above is a navigation bar to help you
 find your way through this website.
 Also, you will need Something called Kali Linux, which is a great way for beginners. It contains alot of tools for hacking.
 I will put a post on the Kali tab explaining how to install, and operate it. If you go to the <a href="pg5.html"> Kali Linux Page </a> the download 
 will be there! </p>
